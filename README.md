# Cricket Analytics Using Machine Learning
## Capstone Project

Our project “Cricket Analytics using Machine Learning” aims to develop a machine learning model that predict the result of a cricket matches at any point of game based on historical dataset. This project also aims to deploy the model as a web application with a good front-end to visualize predictions and analytics.

## Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/govardhan666/cricket_analytics_using_Machine_Learning
    ```

2. Run the Flask app:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the IPL Victory Predictor.

## Usage

1. Select the Batting Team, Bowling Team, Venue, Target, Score, Balls Left, and Wickets Down from the dropdowns and input fields.
2. Click the "Predict Winning Probability" button.
3. View the predicted winning probabilities for both the Batting and Bowling teams.
